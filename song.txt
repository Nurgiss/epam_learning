[Intro: Travis Scott]
Yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm


[Chorus: Travis Scott & Young Thug]
Yup, in my white tee
Yeah, call up Hype Williams for the hype, please
Uh, they gon' wipe you before you wipe me
On boxes of checks, not my Nikes (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Travis Scott, M.I.A. & Young Thug]
Cacti, not no iced tea (Ah)
Uh, got 'em bamboozled like I'm Spike Lee (Ah)
Uh, you need more than Google just to find me (Ah)
Uh, I just called up bae to get her hyphy (Ah, ooh)
Incredible, ici-ici, general
I just start the label just to sign me

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Yeah, yup, call the Sprite people (Call 'em, hol' on, brrt)
Private flight to France, tryna sight-see (On private flights, brrat)
Popped 'em in his hands, he was typin' (Da, da, da)
Caterpillar 'Rari, I fold it, lift it up (Up)
I went on the stand, told the judge to pass my cup (Ayy)
Ran up twenty million, told the Devil, "Keep the luck" (Luck)
Keep that, keep that ho (Uh-uh)
R.I.P. Pop, keep the smoke (Ayy, slatt)
Talk to me nicely (Talk to me nicely)
Keep her on a chain, that ain't like me (That ain't like me)
Scotts with no strings, you can't tie me (Scotts with the, hol' on, bitch)
