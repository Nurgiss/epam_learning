[Intro: Travis Scott]
Yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm


[Chorus: Travis Scott & Young Thug]
Yup, in my white tee
Yeah, call up Hype Williams for the hype, please
Uh, they gon' wipe you before you wipe me
On boxes of checks, not my Nikes (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Travis Scott, M.I.A. & Young Thug]
Cacti, not no iced tea (Ah)
Uh, got 'em bamboozled like I'm Spike Lee (Ah)
Uh, you need more than Google just to find me (Ah)
Uh, I just called up bae to get her hyphy (Ah, ooh)
Incredible, ici-ici, general
I just start the label just to sign me
